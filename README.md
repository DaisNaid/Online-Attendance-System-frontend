# Online-Attendance-System-with-Manual-Class-Control

This project is an online attendance system built to solve the problem of altering attendance records. 
Current attendance systems use client time as a guide as to when to open and close classes. 
This automation allows the possibility of altering attendance records by changing a device's date and time.
This project solves that problem by disregarding the automation process of opening and closing of classes and allowing the respective lecturer of a class to manually open or close his/her class.
This project also features a six letter OTP code for authentication.

Future Works on the Project:
Adding an extra layer of authenticaton using fingerprint.
